This repository accompanies the work "[TBD]" (ref)
It contains all the code necessary to reproduce the analyses. 
Each subsection contains a README that contains a description of the path placeholders. 

## How to reproduce the analyses

To reproduce the analyses, one first needs to download the data available at XXX ([Instructions](link))

Then, one needs to run the scripts in order, as some intermediate files generated by the scripts will be re-used in subsequent scripts. 

For the snRNA-seq analysis, one needs to 
- run the preprocessing for each patient ([Instructions](link))
- run the analyses ([Instructions](link))
- run the pyscenic plus scripts ([Instructions](link))
- run the scripts for external validation ([Instructions](link))

For the snATAC-seq analysis, one needs to 
- run the prepocessing scripts ([Instructions](link))
- run BayesPrism for TCGA validation ([Instructions](link))
